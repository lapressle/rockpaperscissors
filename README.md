# rockpaperscissors

This is a project in TOP showing the development of javascript skills.
Here I have developed a game of rock paper scissors to be played with a computer to the best of 5. This shows off various basic skills in js, such as conditionals, loops, randomization, and prompt, all while managing the project/commits through git.
